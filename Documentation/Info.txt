In this Folder, you will find:
The synopsis of the project 
Software Requirements Specifications(SRS) 
Software Design Description(SDD)
Final documentation of the project(Black Book).

Referring to these documents can help you understand how the project was planned and executed. 
This was an undergrad project, hence the documents might seem unnecessarily split into 3 parts(according to the submission criterias), just bare with it.
Black book is the final documentation that will provide proper, structured documentation of the project.
